# MultiGrid-Transformer
Prototype implementation of grid-based token representation for Transformers
# Multidimensional Token Grids for Transformers

This project explores a novel modification to Transformer architecture by extending input/output from 1D token sequences to multidimensional grids, incorporating semantic metasequences.

## 🔍 Summary
- Leverages auxiliary token axes (e.g., frames, roles, abstractions)
- Early tests on synthetic data show improved token prediction accuracy
- Seeks collaboration to apply to real-world benchmarks

## 🧪 Early Results
Toy experiments confirm that enriched axes speed up training and improve accuracy.
